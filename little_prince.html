                As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and
                set out walking once more.<span class="underlined-text"> I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed
                to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span><span class="highlighted-text"> It seemed to me,
                even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> In the moonlight I looked at his pale
                forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
                <span class="colored-text"> "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is
                    invisible..."</span> As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said
                to myself, again:<span class="colored-text"> "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince
                who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower-- the image of a rose
                that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even
                when he is asleep..."</span> And I felt him to be more fragile still.<span class="underlined-text"> I
                felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little
                puff of wind...</span>
