            As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and
            set out walking once more.
        </p>
        <p>
            I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed
            to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.
        </p>
        <p>
            It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of
            hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
        </p>
        <p>
            "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."
        </p>
        <p>
            As his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile, I said
            to myself, again:
        </p>
        <p>
            "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince
            who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower-- the image of a rose
            that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even
            when he is asleep..."
        </p>
        <p>
            And I felt him to be more fragile still.
        </p>
        <p>
            I felt the
            need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be
            extinguished by a little puff of wind...
